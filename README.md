# Shell-Script

A shell script is a script written for a command-line shell, a text-based interface to the operating system. The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It can also be used to automate repetitive tasks, create complex workflows, and perform various system administration tasks.

Shell scripts are written in scripting languages that are interpreted by the shell, such as Bash (Bourne Again SHell), sh (Bourne Shell), zsh (Z Shell), and others, depending on the operating system. These scripts can include a series of commands, control structures (like loops and conditional statements), variables, and functions.

Store all command in file with extenstion.sh
eg docker.sh

In this script:

#!/bin/bash is called a shebang and indicates that the script should be interpreted using the Bash shell.
